# TemporalTell
An important part of Temporal Computing is its complete Seperation from SpaceTime Computing, hopefully this helps.

The importance in this justification can be found in James Smiths text on Space Time Computing, where space time computing is being used to map out the biological human brain to be compatible with neural networking capabilities coordinated by the understandings of computing architecture

I have run into many issues with the people who believe in space time computing, as well as the people who attempt to simply believe in Set theory that states due to using the same word, Temporal computing is actually just computing using the temporal lobe

My annihilation factor would simply state Temporal Computing has nothing to do with Space. Brains being a coordinated part of space, renders that real mathematics theory to Null, as the Temporal can not be understood in a mathematical perspective without the introduction of spatial understandings.
